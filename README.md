# My Special Recipe of Vanilla Velvet Cake
## Inspired by my Daughter
#### My 6 year old daughter likes to eat cake but she does not like the red color. One fine day she asked me *Why you do not make vanilla velevet cake??,Who said velvet can not be white??* I was astonished to hear the words and that day I tried this recipe.
